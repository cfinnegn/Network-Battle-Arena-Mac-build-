##### Build notes for general info #####

 - MENU: Type name and press enter to access main menu
	Menu options: Online play, Training mode, Chip Library, Tutorial guide

 - ONLINE PLAY:
	host/join games

 - Training Mode:
	Single player against training dummy
	Dummy moves randomly and occasionally shoots.

- KEY INPUT MODE (might not be working?)
	- w/a/s/d movement
	- +/= adds chips
	- 5-0 activate corresponding chip from hand
	- Shift activates Navi power
	- Spacebar fires/charges buster
	Checkbox below exit button toggles key overlay

- Movement: there are 2 modes for movement, "swipe" and "tap". 
	The toggle switch above the swipe pad in the bottom left switches between the two 
	(this switch won't stay here, eventually it will become part of a "settings" menu or 
	something like that, but this is just for temporary convenience). 
	In "swipe" mode, you click and drag (with the mouse) within the swipe pad area 
	to move your character (movement is input when your mouse leaves the pad or you release the mouse button), 
	and in "tap" mode, 4 buttons appear on the pad that can be pressed for up/down/let/right movement.

 - Buster: Tapping the buster button fires a shot (invisibly) for 1 damage
	Holding down the buster button will charge your buster. 
	The ring and stars around the buster button (as well as the charge animation) show the charge level
	The 3 levels of charge shot do 10, 20, and 30 damage and also lightly stagger

 - Draw: Clicking the draw button with at least 2 energy (while you have fewer than 6 chips) 
	will spend 2 energy to add a chip

 - Chips: Chips are pulled from the starter folder. 
	By clicking on a chip when you have enough energy, the chip will activate and disappear, 
	other chips will shift into place (chips always fill from the left), and your energy will drop accordingly. 

- Chip Color Combo System:
	When using consecutive chips of the same color, all chips after first will cost 1 less
	White chips will not combo with each other, but will not break other color combos
	Grey chips will not combo with each other, but WILL break other color combos
	Drawing chips breaks the current combo 
 
 - Navi Power
	- Megaman's Navi Power is "Weapon Get". When playing online, you can add a White-code
		copy of the last chip used by your opponent to your hand by pressing the Navi Power
		Button (cost: 3 energy). Buttons image displays what chip will be added.
